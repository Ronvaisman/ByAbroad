# API Credentials Setup Guide - Unified Search Strategy

This guide will walk you through obtaining API credentials for **SerpApi** and **Rainforest API** to enable real product search across multiple platforms in ByAbroad.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security First

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER commit API credentials to Git!**

All credentials should be stored in:
- Environment variables (recommended for production)
- Info.plist entries (for development, add to .gitignore)
- External configuration files (not in repository)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Valid email addresses for API registration
- Understanding of API usage terms and rate limits
- Development environment set up
